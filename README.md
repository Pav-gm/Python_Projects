# Python Programming Challenges

## About

Welcome to my Python Programming Challenges repository! Here, I share my solutions to various interesting and challenging problems I've encountered on LeetCode. This repository serves as a testament to my growing expertise and progress in Python programming and problem-solving.

## My Journey

I started this project to track my development as a programmer. Tackling these challenges has not only improved my Python skills but also honed my analytical and algorithmic thinking.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific problem from LeetCode. Inside each folder, you will find:
- `problem_statement.md`: A description of the problem.
- `solution.py`: My Python solution to the problem.
- `discussion.md`: My thoughts and analysis on the problem and the solution.

## Problem Categories

The problems are categorized based on their difficulty and the concepts they cover, such as:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Machine Learning (if applicable)
- etc.

## How to Navigate

You can browse the repository by problem categories.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, I'm open to discussions and suggestions. If you have ideas on how I can improve my solutions or if you want to discuss the problems, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contact
